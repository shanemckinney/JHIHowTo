Dear Shane,

How are you doing today? I hope you are well. I really enjoyed receiving 
last years Holiday card from you showing off your festive sweater - I had 
never seen such an ugly sweater before.

I feel like we haven't been in touch for a while. We should try to make 
some time for us to catch up. 

I hope to hear from you soon. Your best buddy,

    Eamon.
