Dear Eamon,

How are you doing today? 
- No compliants. 

I hope you are well. 
- And I hope the same for you. 

I really enjoyed receiving last years Holiday card from you showing off your festive sweater - I had 
never seen a sweater with such an interesting design before.
- Funny thing you brought that up, the sweater was actually given to me by a close mutual friend, Freddy Kruger. 

I feel like we haven't been in touch for a while. We should try to make some time for us to catch up. 
- I agree, sir!

I hope to hear from you soon. Your best buddy,
- Ditto. Friends til the end!

  Shane
